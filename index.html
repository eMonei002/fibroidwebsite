          Many treatments focus mainly on temporary relief of pain or heavy bleeding. Fibroid Shrink Solution
          Capsule is designed to provide broader support – including circulation, hormonal balance and womb health –
          as part of a more complete approach. Individual results vary and it should be used alongside
          medical guidance, not in place of it.

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Is this safe for women over 40?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Many women over 40 use herbal products. However, safety can depend on your health history and medications.
          The ingredients are natural, but you should always discuss any new supplement with your doctor first,
          especially if you have a serious condition.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">How many bottles might I need?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          For smaller fibroids, some women choose 2 bottles.
          For multiple or larger fibroids, 3 bottles may provide more extended support.
          Your doctor’s guidance and your scan results are also important in deciding.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">How fast will I see changes?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          Some women report noticing changes within a few weeks – such as lighter flow, less pain, and reduced bloating.
          For more noticeable improvement, 1–2 months of consistent use is often recommended, but results differ
          from person to person.

            <strong>Chinenye Uzo</strong> I had severe lower back pain and heavy bleeding every month.
            After 2 months on this, my last period was more normal. I feel more hopeful now.

            <strong>Rukayat Ajayi</strong> I’ve tried many fibroid drugs in the past,
            but this one felt different. Within about 2 weeks, my cramps reduced a lot.

            <strong>Mercy Ojo</strong> I was told I might need surgery but decided to try this first.
            After 3 weeks, my scan showed some improvement. Grateful I found it 🙌
